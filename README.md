# Pudim Kubernetes Infrastructure

This repository contains the deployments for all the infrastructure of my home server! I have many different programs running on it. This allows me to orchestrate them and make they work together! This k8s cluster has everything from a tor hidden service, an MQTT data logger, a telegram bot, a plex and a couple of different websites!
